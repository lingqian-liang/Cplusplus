#The logic behind the whole project is
#Firstly, read ticker in csv file.
#Secondly, retrieve and parse stock data and market data from Yahoo Finance. (This part is in the Yahoo.h and Yahoo.cpp)
#Thirdly, classify the data according to the excessive return 
#Fourthly, bootstrap the stocks and calculate AAR and CAAR
#Fifthly, plot the result and design a user platform

#Notice: The whole project needs to download the library curl(it is already download in mac) and gunplot, and change dialect 
#language to C++ 11 in order to execute multithreads
